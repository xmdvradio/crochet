# crochet
what this does:
turns a piture into a crochet pattern
you have control over: the dimentions (in stitches), the number of colours, the minimum straight-line spacing between the colours and the stitch ratio

stitch ratio:
crochet a square first, maybe 20 by 20 stitches, then measure the sides to work out the ratio. Usually stitsches are not toattally square and this gives you more fun options for how you make it look

it will hang a little when you import a picture, dont worry, it takes ages i have no idea why.

i would recoment no more than 4 colour (practically speaking, it just gets confusicng when you crochet it)

colours.csv is there to give colour names which is usefull so youre not having to walk into a wool shop asking for "#01fa8b"
